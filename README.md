## 🕹 Rules of the Game

The game is played between a player and the computer. Each selects one of three options: stone, paper, or scissors. Here are the rules:

1. *Stone vs. Scissors*: Stone wins because it can break scissors.
2. *Scissors vs. Paper*: Scissors win because they can cut paper.
3. *Paper vs. Stone*: Paper wins because it can wrap stone.
4. *Same Choices*: If both the player and the computer make the same choice, it's a draw.

You can play up to 5 rounds, or exit the game anytime by choosing 3 when prompted.
